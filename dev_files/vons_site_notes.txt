Busch
"Cold As A Mountain Stream, Smooth As Its Name"
ABV: 5%
American Style Lager
Recommended glassware: Highball
Recommended food pairings: Steak
Busch is brewed with a blend of premium American-grown and imported hops and a combination of malt and corn to provide a pleasant balanced flavor. A refreshingly smooth taste, pleasant hop aroma, and a slightly sweet finish.
